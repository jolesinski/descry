Framework for real-time instance recognition in RGB-D scenes **(under dev)**.

Project developed as part of masters thesis:
*Object recognition in RGB-D images for robotic applications*

### Dependencies:
* C++14 compiler
* OpenCV 3.1
* PCL 1.8 with [fixes](https://github.com/jolesinski/pcl).
* yaml-cpp 0.53
* CUDA 8

### Testing:
Unit and functional tests are implemented within the [Catch](https://github.com/philsquared/Catch) framework.
[Google benchmark](https://github.com/google/benchmark) is used for performance benchmarks.


### Results:
TBD.
